It is a Computer Store where you can buy laptops with the money you earn from the work you do on the site.

## Background

This project was made to learn basics of JavaScript. No frameworks allowed to make sure that we fully understand just how bad vanilla JavaScript is to work with (though it wasn't *that* bad). 

## Install

Simply clone the git repo and open the index.html file. It is just a frontend website, nothing fancy needs to be set up for it. 

## Usage

You can click buttons! If you click "Work" you get money, which then can be put into the bank by clicking "Bank". You will need this money later to buy yourself a laptop. The harder you work the better the laptop you can get. But don't worry, you don't need to work too hard, just enough to be able to take up a loan to get you the rest of the way, neat right? What could possibly go wrong when doing something like that, just remember to pay it back either by transfering more into the bank, or just using the repay loan button :)
